- 👋 Hi, I’m Fernando Leite. Pleased to meet you. 
          - Computer Engineering Student
          - Financial Management, Accountability and Audit (MBA)
          - Business Administration (Grad)
- 🎢 Tech, Music and Art enthusiast since spoke my first words.
          
- 👀 I’m interested in new technologies that will make Data professionals spend more time in decision making instead of manual work. Looking forward to dive into Quantum Machine Learning.
- 📰 I’m currently learning about Data Science and Data Engineering. Getting the best of both worlds. Also, doing my best to get professionally into it.
- 🌱 I’m looking to collaborate mainly on projects about Finance, Health and Social Media fields. Not discarding any other areas, though. Not at all.
